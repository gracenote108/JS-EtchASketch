# Etch-A-Sketch
## Based on The Odin Project

This project has us create an Etch-A-Sketch game where we can draw things on a display. The expectation is to have buttons where we can click on a button to enable etching, clear the display and take an input to set the number of grains for the display to contain. 

I have added additional features on top of the expectation. One is to provide a multicolor button where the colors change randomly when drawing on the grid.
