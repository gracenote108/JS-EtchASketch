# Etch-A-Sketch

Demo: http://niravtech.com/projects/javascript/etchasketch/

Application to simulate the classic kids toy Etch-A-Sketch. One can click and hold the mouse inside the grid and draw things as they like. 

Currently the only way to stop drawing is to release the mouse inside the grid, otherwise a desync will occur.

This program is created using regular JavaScript and is compiled using WebPack.
